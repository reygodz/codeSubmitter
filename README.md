Submit Code Extension

🚀 Submit Code is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows users to submit their code to a local or remote server directly from the editor. It provides an easy-to-use status bar button and a command to send the currently open file's content to a configured API endpoint.

🔘 Status Bar Button: Click the Submit Code button in the VS Code status bar for quick access.

⚙️ Configurable API Endpoint: Users can change the API address in VS Code settings.

🎡 Supports Any Server: Works with any API that accepts file submissions.

📌 How to Install

Method 1: Install from VSIX (Local Installation)

Download the .vsix package (submit-code-extension-1.0.0.vsix).

Open VS Code.

Go to Extensions (``).

Click "..." (More Actions) → Install from VSIX...".

🚀 How to Use

Option 1: Using the Status Bar Button

Open a file in VS Code.

Click the "Submit Code" button in the status bar (bottom right).

The file content is sent to the configured server.

Option 2: Using the Command Palette

Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette.

Search for "Submit Code" and select it.

The active file will be sent to the server.

⚙️ Configuring the API Endpoint

By default, the extension sends requests to:

http://localhost:3000/api/submit

If your server has a different address, you can update it in VS Code settings:

Open File → Preferences → Settings (Ctrl + ,).

Search for "Submit Code API Address".

Update it with your server's API address.

Alternatively, edit settings.json manually:

{
  "submitCode.apiAddress": "http://your-server-ip:5000/api/submit"
}

🖥️ API Requirements

Your server should accept a POST request at the configured API address with the following JSON payload:

{
  "fileName": "example.py",
  "code": "print('Hello, World!')"
}

It should return a JSON response:

{
  "message": "Code received successfully!"
}

🔧 Troubleshooting

No active editor found! → Open a file before running the command.

Error submitting code → Check if your server is running and the API address is correct.

Status bar button is missing → Try restarting VS Code.
